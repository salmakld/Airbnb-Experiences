# Airbnb Experiences clone with React

## Description
In this project, I use data from the file `data.js`. It contains a list of objects.

## Install dependencies
In order to clone the repo, open your terminal and type: 

    git clone https://github.com/salmakld/Airbnb-clone-with-react.git

To install the required dependencies, cd into `Airbnb-Experiences` and type:
    
    npm install    

In fact, the file `package.json` keeps track of all the different kinds of dependencies used in the project. Directly running a specific command for installing a dependency as an npm package process updates automatically the `package.json` file with the required details (dependency's name, version and type). 

## Run the project
To run the app in the development mode use: 

    npm start

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
